# Construction ERP — Decision Log

This log records durable architecture and business-policy decisions. Live GitHub state remains authoritative for implementation status.

## DEC-001 — Modular Monolith
**Status:** APPROVED

Use a modular-monolith architecture. Do not introduce microservices without a genuine requirement and approved change control.

## DEC-002 — PostgreSQL + Prisma
**Status:** APPROVED

PostgreSQL is the canonical relational database and Prisma is the approved ORM/migration layer.

## DEC-003 — Activity terminology
**Status:** APPROVED

`Activity` is the canonical technical/database/API term. `Task` may be used only as a UI/business synonym. Do not create separate Activity and Task entities.

## DEC-004 — WBS and Cost Code are independent
**Status:** APPROVED

WBS identifies where work/cost occurs. Cost Code identifies the nature/type of cost. Cost Code is not a child of WBS.

## DEC-005 — Project scope authorization
**Status:** APPROVED

Project-scoped access is derived from User → optional active Employee link → active Project Member → Project. `projects.access_all` bypasses assignment filtering only and does not grant edit, approval, Finance, Procurement or other business authority.

## DEC-006 — Technical administrator separation
**Status:** APPROVED

System Administrator is a technical/admin role and must not automatically gain business approval authority. Business authority comes from explicit permissions/configured approval roles.

## DEC-007 — Project creation access policy
**Status:** PENDING BUSINESS DECISION

For a user who has `projects.project.create` but does not have `projects.access_all`, select one policy before finalizing Project creation:

- A — Creator membership: creator must be linked to an active Employee and included in the initial Project Team.
- B — Admin assignment later: allow creation without membership; creator may immediately lose access.
- C — Restricted creation: only users with `projects.access_all` may create Projects.

No option is approved yet. Technical Stage E work that does not depend on this choice may continue.
